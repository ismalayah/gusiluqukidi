Till date, she is lives in the suburb area of Monaco. Likewise, <i>Game of Thrones</i> actress, <a href=#><strong>Lena Headey</strong></a> stays single following her two tragic divorces.</p><h2>From Marina's First Meeting with Bjorn Borg to Tying the Knot...</h2><p>One of the most highlighted love stories in the sports was Mariana and <strong>Bjorn Borg</strong>'s broken marriage. The couple had their first encounter at The French Open in Paris, France. But, they interacted during the birthday party of Bjorn's tennis coach on <i>10th June 1976</i>.</p><p>However, the duo had a language barrier for almost a year which they disclosed in an interview. Despite the fact, they accepted one another as husband and wife &nbsp;on <i>24th July 1980</i> at the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Bucharest City Hall </a>in Bucharest, Romania after dating for four years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/6/16/Webp.net-resizeimage%20-%202021-06-16T211352.183-1623857652412.jpg><p>The whole world shocked when the pair announced their separation and filed for divorce after four years marriage. They later concluded their divorce at the end of <i>1984</i>. At that time, there were some rumors that Mariana received <strong>$8,340,360 </strong>(<strong>Â£6,000,000</strong>) as a <a href=# rel=nofollow>divorce alimony</a> from Bjorn, but it was absolutely not true.</p><h2>Past Marital Affairs of Mariana's Ex-Husband, Borg</h2><p>Following the divorce settlement, Mariana's estranged husband, Bjorn became involved in a romantic relationship with a Swedish model, <strong>Jannike Bjorling</strong>. Later, they welcomed a son, <strong>Robin Bjorling Borg </strong>in <i>1985</i>. However, they split up in <i>1989</i>, due to some misunderstandings.&nbsp;</p><p>Mariana's ex-marital partner, Borg, further, exchanged his wedding vows with an Italian singer, <strong>Loredana Berte</strong> in <i>1989</i>.
