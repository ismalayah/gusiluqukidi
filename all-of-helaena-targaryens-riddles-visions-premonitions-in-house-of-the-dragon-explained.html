If anything, she should be given more attention because her words, which might seem like nonsense at first, portend major events in season one, and those yet to come.</p><p data-characters=15 data-current-count=322 data-injectable=false><strong>Spoilers ahead.</strong></p><p data-characters=638 data-current-count=960 data-injectable=true>Helaena has what’s called dragon dreams, just like many other Targaryen who have had them throughout the ages. King Viserys tells his daughter, Princess Rhaenyra of Aegon, the Conqueror’s prophecy of a terrible winter coming from the north — and we all know how that went down in Game of Thrones. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alicent’s third son</a>, who is yet to be seen in House of the Dragon, will also have dragon dreams. Daenerys Targaryen had them as well when she foresaw the Iron Throne burned with ash falling down in the King’s Landing while visiting the House of the Undying in season two of GoT, she has a vision of the Iron Throne.</p><p data-characters=110 data-current-count=110 data-injectable=false>The riddles, visions, and premonitions Helaena has had are enigmatic, but analyzing them reveals great truths.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=410 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Making an entrance. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/l3GYi83Wpt</a></p>— House of the Dragon (@HouseofDragon) <a href=#>October 26, 2022</a></figure><h2 id=h-it-has-eyes-though-i-don-t-believe-it-can-see data-injectable=false>“It has eyes, though I don’t believe it can see”</h2><p data-characters=761 data-current-count=761 data-injectable=true>In House of the Dragon, episode six, “The Princess and the Queen,” Helaena is playing with a centipede. Centipedes actually do have bad eyesight, so they have to use their antennae to detect their surroundings and find prey, but like all great prophecies, there’s a double meaning there. Helaena’s assessment of those being unable to see likely involves multiple people who are solely driven by their aspirations and can’t see what’s really happening. Alicent is at the top of this list. She’s so blinded by her hate for Rhaenyra that she’s consumed by it. She poisons her children into believing that Rhaenyra will come for them without acknowledging that her former friend has tried to repair their old wounds.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>“He’ll have to close an eye”</h2><p data-characters=543 data-current-count=543 data-injectable=true>This vision-related prophecy is about her brother Aemond Targaryen. A prank was played on him where he was given a pig as a dragon jokingly named the “pig dragon.” This led to Aemond’s desire to have a real dragon of his own, and in episode six, he sets his sights on Vhagar, the late Laena’s dragon. He rides the winged beast and when he returns to Driftmark Castle, Rhaenyra’s boys and Daemon’s girls beat him down. In the scuffle, Lucerys cuts out his eye. He gains a dragon, but at the cost of his eye.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>“The last ring has no legs at all”</h2><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>This event has yet to happen, so if you don’t want this spoiled, avert your gaze. In Fire & Blood, King Aegon, loses his legs when he leaps from his dragon Sunfyre. He’s there battling Dreamfyre above Dragonstone and suffice it to say things end tragically for him.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>“Hand turns loom; spool of green, spool of black. Dragons of flesh, weaving dragons of thread”</h2><p data-characters=602 data-current-count=883 data-injectable=true>In episode seven, “Driftmark,” Helaena makes this foreboding revelation about the Dance of Dragons. The “Hand” in this case refers to Otto Hightower, who will eventually return to the role of Hand after Lord Lyonel Strong leaves Kings Landing for his ill-fated stay at Harrenhal. He’s made long-laid plans with Jason Lannister and members of the Green Council to install Aegon as king, which is the catalyst for this war. The Hightower family are the Greens and Rhaenyra Targaryen’s side is referred to as the Blacks, and both sides will use dragons to win this war.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>“Then the storm broke, and the dragons danced.” <a href=#>#HOTDFinale</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/B0pNsc0PxS</a></p>— House of the Dragon (@HouseofDragon) <a href=#>October 24, 2022</a></figure><h2 data-injectable=false>“It is our fate, I think, to crave what is given to another. If one possesses a thing, the other will take it away”</h2><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=717 data-injectable=true>In episode nine, “The Green Council,” Helaena says this while playing with her children. It’s possible she’s referring to the history between Rhaenyra and Alicent. Rhaenyra has been named heir to the Iron Throne, but Alicent claimed that King Viserys wanted their son Aegon on the throne. With haste, they seated and crowned Aegon as the king and now Rhaenyra has to fight for her crown back.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>“There is a beast beneath the boards”</h2><p data-characters=592 data-current-count=592 data-injectable=true>These words by Healaena turned out to be frighteningly true. In “The Green Council,” the Greens have locked Princess Rhaenys in her room to keep her from escaping and alerting Princess Rhaenyra about their rebellion. Thanks to Ser Erryk Cargyll, she’s able to escape and make it to Aegon’s coronation in the Grand Sept that houses her dragon. She slips away and from beneath the feet, a rumble starts, then Rhaenys and her dragon, Meleys, bursts up from the floor. Meleys roars at the Greens assembled on the platform, then flies off to Dragonstone to tell the Blacks.</p><p data-characters=181 data-current-count=181 data-injectable=false>Helaena will probably spill more prophecies in House of the Dragon season two and when Alicent’s other son Daeron appears, he’ll probably have some gems to drop as well.</p><p data-characters=57 data-current-count=238 data-injectable=false>All episodes of House of Dragon are streaming on HBO Max.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yiuMtmpp9lmJq5orHNmmStmaKcrrPFxKeqZqqZmbGtsdJmraKrmaS7tHnPq5ymp56ewaq7zaxkoqZdnby2v8Rmpp9lpJ2ybrDRmp6opl2axbG4wKKlnpxf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fall-of-helaena-targaryens-riddles-visions-premonitions-in-house-of-the-dragon-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fall-of-helaena-targaryens-riddles-visions-premonitions-in-house-of-the-dragon-explained.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fall-of-helaena-targaryens-riddles-visions-premonitions-in-house-of-the-dragon-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fall-of-helaena-targaryens-riddles-visions-premonitions-in-house-of-the-dragon-explained.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fall-of-helaena-targaryens-riddles-visions-premonitions-in-house-of-the-dragon-explained.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fall-of-helaena-targaryens-riddles-visions-premonitions-in-house-of-the-dragon-explained.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./where-was-constance-lynn-campbell-last-seen-missing-disney-cast-member-found-dead-626506-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./where-was-constance-lynn-campbell-last-seen-missing-disney-cast-member-found-dead-626506-html.html>Where was Constance Lynn Campbell last seen?
