<time>09 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Several nations’ qualification for the 2022 FIFA World Cup has been confirmed during the current international break. From 2021 Copa America champions Argentina to reigning world champions France to five-time sponsors Brazil, a slew of elite nations has recently confirmed their participation in next year’s football extravaganza.</p><h2>Ronaldo and Messi may play in their final FIFA World Cup in 2022.</h2><p>The upcoming World Cup will most likely be the final one to feature Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. While the PSG star’s team confirmed their spot yesterday, Ronaldo’s Portugal will have to compete in the FIFA World Cup playoffs to qualify for next year’s tournament.</p><p>Despite the uncertainty surrounding Ronaldo’s presence, many essential players are poised to take center stage in Qatar. In contrast to club football, it can be difficult to predict the value of a national team accurately. However, the following are the five most valuable teams that have already confirmed their participation in next year’s FIFA World Cup:</p><h2>Number 5: Spain (€728 million)</h2><p>Spain fared reasonably well in the qualifiers. Alvaro Morata’s late goal gave Spain the victory over Sweden in the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The success guaranteed their place in next year’s FIFA World Cup.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Spain.jpg><p>The Spanish national team is worth €728 million, placing them fifth on this list. Rodri, Manchester City’s defensive midfielder, is the club’s most valuable asset (worth €70 million). Midfielders Koke (€60 million) and Dani Olmo (€50 million) are among their most valuable players.</p><p>Given that Spain has produced some world-class midfielders over the years, it’s not surprising that their top three most valuable footballers play in the center of the field. With 19 points from eight matches, Spain topped Group B’s European leg of the FIFA World Cup qualifiers.</p><h2>Number 4: Argentina (€747.50 million)</h2><p>The Copa America champions are the most recent team to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Despite a 0-0 draw with rivals Brazil, Argentina has managed to pull away from the teams below them in their qualifying group. As a result, they have qualified mathematically for the tournament in Qatar.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Argentina.webp><p>Despite not being at his best this season, Lionel Messi remains the most valuable player in the Argentine squad. Messi and Lautaro Martinez are both worth €80 million. The pair boost Argentina’s overall valuation of €747.50 million.</p><p>In 2022, La Albiceleste will compete for their third FIFA World Cup title. The Argentine players would love to win the trophy for Messi because it would be a wonderful gift for the player who has carried them for over a decade. Argentina is currently ranked second in the South American FIFA World Cup qualifiers, trailing only Brazil.</p><h2>Number 3: Brazil (€870.50 million)</h2><p>Brazil has long been associated with the FIFA World Cup. When Neymar and co. Kick-off in Qatar next year, and they will be playing in their 22nd consecutive FIFA World Cup. Brazil’s qualification became a reality when they defeated Colombia a week ago.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Brazil.jpg><p>The Selecao has several players worth more than €50 million. Some of Brazil’s most valuable players include Marquinhos (€75 million), Casemiro (€70 million), Liverpool duo Alisson and Fabinho (both €60 million), and Gabriel Jesus (€60 million). With a price tag of €100 million, Neymar remains Brazil’s most valuable player.</p><p>Despite failing to win Copa America this year, Brazil could be one of the favorites next year. They haven’t lived up to expectations in recent FIFA World Cups, but if they can justify their €870.50 million team value, they could turn a few heads.</p><h2>Number 2: France (€978.80 million)</h2><p>France was a heavy favorite to win the Euros this year, but things didn’t go their way. Instead, the reigning world champions hope to add to their trophy cabinet by winning Qatar’s 2022 FIFA World Cup.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/France.webp><p>They qualified by winning Group D, and their participation in next year’s event is a result of their 8-0 the thrashing of Kazakhstan.</p><p>The French national team comprises players who play in Europe’s top leagues. Kylian Mbappe is the most expensive player in the France squad (€160 million). Each of Paul Pogba, Dayot Upamecano, and Jules Kounde has a market value of €60 million.</p><p>The current France squad is worth €978.80 million, thanks mainly to talisman Kylian Mbappe. France had an easy time in Group D, going unbeaten and collecting 18 points from eight matches during the FIFA World Cup qualifiers.</p><h2>Number 1: England (€1.23 billion)</h2><p><strong>England</strong> is the most valuable football team in the world. The Three Lions’ rise is due to the talented youngsters produced by the country in recent years. England qualified for the 2022 FIFA World Cup after defeating San Marino 10-0. In the ten FIFA World Cup qualifiers, the free-scoring team led by Harry Kane scored 39 goals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/England.jpg><p>Their €1.23 billion valuations result from a large number of players valued between €70 and €100 million. England’s market value is boosted by Jack Grealish, Raheem Sterling, Phil Foden, Trent-Alexander Arnold, and Mason Mount. However, at €120 million, Harry Kane remains their most valuable player.</p><p>Solid performances on the pitch have recently justified the Group I winners’ market value. The semi-finalists from the 2018 FIFA World Cup progressed to the Euro 2020 finals. It will be interesting to see if their young players can finally bring football home in the FIFA World Cup in 2022.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirqKhdanquu9KtZK%2BZnKquo7jEZquemZ2oeri0zmafmq6VYr62rcuinaKdlGKzsL6MrZ%2BeZWJlf3N5xaKdmmWnpL%2BtsIycrKln</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftop-5-most-valuable-teams-who-have-qualified-for-the-2022-fifa-world-cup.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftop-5-most-valuable-teams-who-have-qualified-for-the-2022-fifa-world-cup.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftop-5-most-valuable-teams-who-have-qualified-for-the-2022-fifa-world-cup.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftop-5-most-valuable-teams-who-have-qualified-for-the-2022-fifa-world-cup.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftop-5-most-valuable-teams-who-have-qualified-for-the-2022-fifa-world-cup.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftop-5-most-valuable-teams-who-have-qualified-for-the-2022-fifa-world-cup.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./moon-knight-almost-recreates-the-iconic-spider-man-no-way-home-meme.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./moon-knight-almost-recreates-the-iconic-spider-man-no-way-home-meme.html>Moon Knight almost recreates the iconic Spider-Man: No Way Home meme</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./les-dennis-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-560126-html.html>Les Dennis Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./les-dennis-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-560126-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
