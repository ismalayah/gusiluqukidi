These mistakes were foiling the plan to blindside <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Julie Alley</a> in episode 11, as well as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">failing to properly use his Amulet turned Hidden Immunity Idol</a> in order to save <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Drew Basile</a> (his closest ally in the game) in episode 12.</p><p data-characters=218 data-current-count=218 data-injectable=false>As mentioned, the beginning of his demise began in episode 11. In an attempt to blindside&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Julie</a>, the plan seemed to be in motion until Austin told Dee, something that he will regret for the rest of his life…</p><p data-characters=481 data-current-count=699 data-injectable=true>Given the best friendship that Dee&nbsp;and&nbsp;Julie formed with one another, the former told the latter, ultimately causing the plan to fall apart. Julie played her Hidden Immunity Idol at tribal council (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">which Austin had handed to her a few days prior</a>), causing just one vote to determine who would be heading to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ponderosa</a>&nbsp;that fateful night. While Julie talked about casting her vote for Austin, she casted her vote for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Emily Flippen</a> instead, ultimately leading to her untimely exit.</p><p data-characters=410 data-current-count=410 data-injectable=true>When the roles were reversed and there was a plan to blindside Austin’s closest ally in episode 12, Dee kept her mouth shut, ultimately sealing her fate as the winner of Survivor 45. At final tribal council, the difference in the duo’s gameplay was brought to light, causing the jury to view Dee as a smarter, more strategic player than Austin andcausing her to defeat him in a five to three vote.</p><p data-characters=158 data-current-count=158 data-injectable=false>Why did Austin tell Dee the plan, and does he regret it? In an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive interview with Entertainment Weekly</a> post-show, the 26-year-old spilled the tea…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Austin-Li-Coon-Survivor.png><p data-characters=155 data-current-count=155 data-injectable=false>In said interview, reporter Dalton Ross asked, “How does this game play out differently if you do&nbsp;not&nbsp;tell Dee about the Julie vote?”</p><p data-characters=287 data-current-count=442 data-injectable=true>Naturally, the graduate student sang like a bird, walking Dalton Ross through the alternate scenarios and admitting that “It’s something [he has] definitely thought about a lot” since filming for Survivor 45 wrapped this past summer. This mistake has been haunting him!</p><p data-characters=638 data-current-count=638 data-injectable=true>“If I did not tell Dee about the Julie vote, then I think Drew and Emily get put in a much better position. It helps their games more than it helps my games. It would give them a lot of the power. To Drew, he’d become the most insulated person at that point of the game, having Emily and me as his number ones, and then Dee would lose a lot of trust in me. She probably would still want to work with me, but that was kind of unclear, so I was worried about losing my positioning in the game,” he dished, admitting that he does regret his decision, however, he is glad that he did not give Drew and Emily any more power.</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>Walking through all of the potential paths to the finale had he kept quiet that fateful day, Austin is unclear what would have happened had he not foiled the plan, but he knew one thing for certain: “I needed both Drew and Dee to make sure that I could get to the end.”</p><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=607 data-injectable=false>Nonetheless, while he might not have taken home the title of “Sole Survivor” and the million-dollar cash prize, to watch Austin Li Coon’s journey on the beloved competition series from start to finish, fans of the franchise can stream the entirety of&nbsp;Survivor 45&nbsp;via Paramount Plus now. It is truly a must-see!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqwNJmqqillam1qrrGZqCvnV2Zsqe1zaKrnqSpYsGpu9Sgn61lkZe8tsCMmmSlp6RixKmt02aumqtdlsK0wMinZKWhXZi8sLrSZpmin5eawLV50Z6eq52kYrOzu8xmqq6qpp7DsL6MbWxo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fits-something-ive-definitely-thought-about-a-lot-what-was-austin-li-coons-biggest-regret-from-survivor-45.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fits-something-ive-definitely-thought-about-a-lot-what-was-austin-li-coons-biggest-regret-from-survivor-45.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fits-something-ive-definitely-thought-about-a-lot-what-was-austin-li-coons-biggest-regret-from-survivor-45.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fits-something-ive-definitely-thought-about-a-lot-what-was-austin-li-coons-biggest-regret-from-survivor-45.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fits-something-ive-definitely-thought-about-a-lot-what-was-austin-li-coons-biggest-regret-from-survivor-45.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fits-something-ive-definitely-thought-about-a-lot-what-was-austin-li-coons-biggest-regret-from-survivor-45.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./madison-2005.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./madison-2005.html>Madison movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2005)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./all-star-lineup-sings-joni-mitchells-big-yellow-taxi.html>All-star Lineup Performs &amp;quot;Big Yellow Taxi | Great Performances</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./all-star-lineup-sings-joni-mitchells-big-yellow-taxi.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
