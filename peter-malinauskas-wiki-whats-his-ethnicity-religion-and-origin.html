<time>29 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>What religion does Peter Malinauskas follow?</strong> Learn about the politician’s life as his wife, Annabel prepares to have their fourth child. Malinauskas, Peter Bryden, is a politician. Since March 2022, he has served as South Australia’s 47th and current premier.</p><p>He has been the South Australian branch leader of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and a member of the House of Assembly (MHA) for the Croydon district since April 2018. From 2018 until 2022, he was the leader of the Opposition before bringing his party to victory in the state election. Malinauskas has been a Labor member of the South Australian House of Assembly representing the Croydon electorate since 2018. In addition, from 2015 and 2018, the politician sat in the South Australian Legislative Council.</p><h2>Peter&nbsp;Malinauskas Religion: What’s His Nationality?</h2><p><strong>Peter Malinauskas</strong> is a devout Catholic who practices Christianity. The fact that he was reared a Catholic and still practices his religion has gone unmentioned. Malinauskas, from a Catholic family, was transferred to Mercedes College, where he excelled academically and showed leadership potential in cricket and sports.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Peter-Malinauskas-1.jpg alt="Peter Malinauskas" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He was the 12th-grade school captain and a member of the student representative council. Peter Daw, the principal of Mercedes College, recognized Malinauskas as “a future leader.” According to Daw, the politician was also “one of those kids involved in a lot of things,” a “popular lad,” and had a “magnetic personality that appealed to teachers and students alike.”&nbsp;Furthermore, Labor’s leader is depicted as a regular Australian during the election campaign, as a father who likes gardening on weekends and playing soccer.</p><p>Mr. Snelling and Mr. Kenyon’s resignations from the party conveyed a message to Labor’s powerful Catholic Right faction, which Mr. Malinauskas leads, that the party needed to do more to reflect the faction’s views.&nbsp;Mr. Snelling voiced concern about the rising “restrictions on religious freedom” in Australia, echoing the sentiments of Liberal conservatives.&nbsp;Furthermore, when Mr. Farrell left the SDA to become a senator at the age of 27, Mr. Malinauskas took over as state secretary, replacing then-senator Linda Kirk, who violated the SDA’s Catholic traditions by supporting the morning-after abortion pill.&nbsp;When questioned about homosexual marriage, stem-cell research, euthanasia, and abortion, Mr. Malinauskas said that his views would be “considered socially conservative.”</p><h2>Family of Peter Malinauskas: Ethnicity And Origin</h2><p>Peter Malinauskas was raised in a Catholic household. The politician is said to be of mixed race. The politician was born in South Australia. On August 14, 1980, Malinauskas was born to his father, Peter Malinauskas, and mother, Kathryn née May. Eta, Malinauskas’ paternal grandmother, emigrated to Bathurst, New South Wales, after escaping the communist rule in postwar Hungary.&nbsp;She married Peter Malinauskas Sr., a Lithuanian immigrant, and they moved to Adelaide, where they subsequently opened a fish and chip store. Malinauskas’ mother’s ancestors were middle-class Irish folks.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Peter-Malinauskas-2.jpg alt="Peter Malinauskas" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Throughout his childhood, Malinauskas’ family resided at Colonel Light Gardens.
