He was born on August 18th, 1999, and his Zodiac sign is Leo.</p><p>The talented DJ is often celebrated by his dad on his birthdays as the duo share a strong affinity. Black Coffee ensures that his son knows how much he loves him and makes it public by <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">posting</a> heartfelt messages for him on Instagram on his birthdays. He even <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">hosts</a> lavish parties for him sometimes and that was seen when Sona turned 21 in the year 2020.</p><h2 dir=auto><strong>Who Is Esona Maphumulo’s Mom?</strong></h2><p>Esona Maphumulo’s mother is unknown, and it is uncertain whether Black Coffee was married to her at the time Sona was born. However, in the IG post he shared on his son’s 18th birthday in August 2017, the acclaimed record producer <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">disclosed</a> that he had his first child, Esona Maphumulo at the age of 23.</p><p lang=qme dir=ltr>❤️ <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/rQ5IfQsZGC</a></p><p>— SONA (@esonaaaaa) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">June 19, 2022</a></p><p>He was a student then and had no job. Nevertheless, the period was one of the happiest moments of his life. The birth of his son motivated him and gave him a reason to chase all his dreams. Nkosinathi Maphumulo also revealed that his son’s mother named him Esona Sinokuhle.</p><p>Furthermore, between 2011 and 2019, Sona had a stepmother in the person of <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Enhle Mbali</a> whom his father married in 2011 and they later <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>divorced</a> in 2019. His ex-stepmother is an actress, TV presenter, and fashion designer well-known for scoring the role of Lindi Mabaso in Rockville. After his father’s divorce, it was alleged that Esona Maphumulo didn’t get along with his stepmom.</p><h2 dir=auto><strong>Meet Esona Maphumulo’s Siblings</strong></h2><p>Although DJ Black Coffee is known to be a father of four children, he is said to have welcomed other children outside wedlock whilst married to Mbali. Hence, Esona Maphumulo’s known siblings are Lilitha Maphumulo, Anesu Maphumulo, and Asante Maphumulo.</p><p>Just like Esona, Lilitha’s mother is still unidentified, whereas, Asante and Anesu are the children Black Coffee had with his estranged wife, Enhle Mbali. While Anesu was born in 2012, Asante was born in the year 2015. Surprisingly, after Maphumulo’s split from Mbali, it was reported that he had other children with different women.</p><p>As of December 2019 when the news about his unknown two children broke out, they were <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">reportedly</a> 12 months old and 14 months old. Additionally, in that same month, a woman named Mimi Buthelezi <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">claimed</a> to share a 3-year-old daughter with the international DJ. However, Black Coffee has not denied or confirmed the report about his other unknown children.</p><h2 dir=auto><strong>Sona Has Had Many International DJing Gigs</strong></h2><p>Following in his father’s giant footsteps, Esona Maphumulo took to disc jockeying soon after completing his basic education. He was coached by his dad for a long time as both of them often attend his gigs and equally toured together. Since 2022, Esona has toured many countries performing sets.</p><p lang=ro dir=ltr>“Vuka gogo masiy’ esontweni” <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/4J3dmRe60C</a></p><p>— SONA (@esonaaaaa) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">May 9, 2022</a></p><p>In July 2022, he performed at Club Chinois in Ibiza and also had a gig in both France and Mexico in January 2023. Two months later, he performed at an event held in the United Kingdom. Then in May 2023, he visited Monaco for a DJing gig. The 24-year-old has additionally performed at events held in South Africa’s popular cities, including <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Johannesburg</a>.</p><h3><strong>Is DJ Black Coffee’s Son Taking His DJing Too Far?</strong></h3><p>Esona Maphumulo made headlines in April 2023 when he shared a video of himself performing a set with one hand (just like his father) at a party held in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Though many people were impressed with his performance, a few others took to social media to <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">criticize</a> him for using one hand to perform when he is only at the early stages of his career and should be using both hands.</p><p>Sona, not finding the comments funny, quickly defended himself in a Twitter post. He explained that for a long time, he had made sure that of his hands were visible in the pictures he shared to avoid negative narratives. He, however, decided for once to hold his drink with his left hand and it became news, with several people attacking him.</p><h2 dir=auto><strong>Which Song Did Esona Maphumulo Produce For Drake?</strong></h2><p>Following the release of Drake’s 7th album, ‘Honestly, Nevermind’ in June 2022, it was noticed that DJ Black Coffee was <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">credited</a> as the co-producer and co-writer of three songs from the album. Interestingly, Esona Maphumulo was also credited as the co-producer of one of the songs in the album titled, ‘Texts Go Green’.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>“Texts Go Green”<br>Produced By SONA<br>🦉 <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/OFSr1wSW6E</a></p><p>— SONA (@esonaaaaa) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">June 17, 2022</a></p><p>Afterward, Sona’s dad explained that the Canadian rapper sent him the vocal for the song which was very uptempo. Hence, he struggled to make a beat for the song and eventually, his son helped him to produce a beat for it. ‘Texts Go Green’ did quite well on many music charts and Esona was proud of his achievement which he shared with his followers on Twitter. His father also <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">congratulated</a> him for attaining such a milestone.</p><h2 dir=auto><strong>Esona Maphumulo Was Appointed the Director of His Father’s Two Companies in 2022</strong></h2><p>In November 2022, Esona’s dad handed him executive roles at his two <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>companies</a>. Black Coffee <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">made</a> his son the director of the Black Coffee Foundation, having resigned from the role. Esona Maphumulo also was listed as the director of the Soulistic Agency, which represents his father. He is said to have signed under the agency before he was made the director.</p><p>Consequently, the 24-year-old DJ is on track to becoming one of the wealthiest young company executives in South Africa. He now helms the affair of the Black Coffee Foundation together with his aunt, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Nomalungelo Amanda Dandala</a>, and his paternal grandmother, Sindiswa Dandala, who work as the directors of the foundation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaKWVmsFusdKopZplnZa9qcHMrqOoZZSfeqO4wJyiZpufm7OmsdJmqqimXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeet-esona-maphumulo-dj-black-coffees-son.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmeet-esona-maphumulo-dj-black-coffees-son.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmeet-esona-maphumulo-dj-black-coffees-son.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmeet-esona-maphumulo-dj-black-coffees-son.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeet-esona-maphumulo-dj-black-coffees-son.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-esona-maphumulo-dj-black-coffees-son.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./rainbow-valley.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./rainbow-valley.html>Rainbow Valley - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./steven-dial.html>Steven Dial</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./steven-dial.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
