Enter: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Batman: The Brave and the Bold</strong></a>, a live-action movie that shares a name with the beloved animated series that ran from 2008-2011. As soon as news of the film dropped, it led to plenty of excited lovers of Bruce Wayne to do some fan-casting online, and it seems that in the eyes of the fandom, an early frontrunner for the role is The Invisible Man and The Haunting of Hill House star Oliver Jackson-Cohen.</p>Recommended Videos<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Oliver Jackson-Cohen as Batman for The Brave and The Bold. What‚Äôs y‚Äôall think? Thought he would be a decent choice. He has the perfect look that‚Äôs the balance of Bruce Wayne and Batman vibe and he‚Äôs in his mid-30s for a role in the DCU.</a><br>by <a href=#>u/Commercial-Mix-2633</a> in <a href=#>DC_Cinematic</a></figure><p data-characters=736 data-current-count=1036 data-injectable=true>The prospect of Jackson-Cohen playing Batman is getting a lot of love on the DC_Cinematic subreddit thanks to his rugged good looks and the fact he‚Äôs around the right age to portray Gotham‚Äôs most famous superhero. Although he‚Äôs not a complete unknown, he is much less famous than the last two actors who were given the role, which could mean more opportunity for him to craft the character in a way that‚Äôs unique to him. However, some fans are holding that against him, pointing out that Jackson-Cohen might not have the star power to pull off such an iconic part. Add in the fact that by the time production rolls around, he‚Äôs likely to be 40, and there are some hiccups in this seemingly perfect casting.</p><p data-characters=537 data-current-count=537 data-injectable=true>The English actor certainly has the acting ability to excel as the Dark Knight, as shown by his complex and often mesmerizing performances in the Hill House anthologies. His turn in The Invisible Man as the titular character was also incredibly powerful, even though he only had a few lines, which further confirms his ability to play a part as multifaceted as Bruce Wayne. Whether or not he gets the role, it‚Äôs clear that he‚Äôs come a long way from his origins on the slightly trashy yet ever-engaging British soap Hollyoaks.</p><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=279 data-injectable=false>There are a few other names being bandied about on social media to play Batman in the upcoming film, from Jake Gyllenhaal to Jensen Ackles. But, for now, it seems like we won‚Äôt be getting a definitive answer on who‚Äôll don the famous cape and mask for quite some time.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=579 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>James Gunn confirms they‚Äôre casting a new actor for DCU Batman Brave and the Bold <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Fk6yumeffW</a></p>‚Äî BLURAYANGEL ü¶á (@blurayangel) <a href=#>February 11, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jensen Ackles as DCU Batman in The Brave and the Bold is perfect casting <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/tbyXHhObe7</a></p>‚Äî ess (@AlexSheen0) <a href=#>January 31, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=696 data-current-count=996 data-injectable=true>Another one of the more intriguing features of this new Batman film is the introduction of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Damian Wayne, the estranged son of Batman.</a> In the source material the film is based on, Damian ends up becoming Robin and helping his dad fight crime, so whomever is cast as him is likely to have a sizeable role. Given that the character could be anywhere from 10 to a teen (depending on how Gunn sees the film unfolding, and how closely he sticks to source material), there are a whole host of actors who could potentially play the part. With that all said, the role might even be taken by someone who‚Äôs completely unknown, given how young this Robin is supposed to be and how far away filming is.</p><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=342 data-injectable=false>In the comics, Damian is the son of Bruce Wayne and his occasional enemy and lover Talia al Guhl. As Talia is of East Asian heritage, this might be a rare opportunity for Gunn to blood in some minority talent ‚Äî although some fans have already been making fun of the prospect of Gunn and the other DCU heads making a terrible casting choice.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=642 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tom Holland has been cast as Damian Wayne in ‚ÄòTHE BRAVE AND THE BOLD‚Äô</p><p>Casting for Batman is reportedly still underway</p><p>(Source: Deadline) <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/INdAlMf050</a></p>‚Äî Michael üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (@batmannshill) <a href=#>April 1, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=730 data-current-count=730 data-injectable=true>Something else that Gunn has to navigate is the fact that the phrase Brave and the Bold has a long history in the DC Fandom, being a common description of the Justice League. The phrase is also the title of a comic book series (that‚Äôs been running with some small gaps since 1955), and the original content mostly involved crossover battles between various DC favorites. The animated Batman: The Brave and the Bold followed a similar format, with the Dark Knight often teaming up with his fellow heroes to save the day. As anybody who‚Äôs spent ten seconds online knows, comic book fandoms can be ruthless when it comes to deviating too heavily from tradition, so the Suicide Squad director will have to tread carefully.</p><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>With that all said, there‚Äôs no doubt that Gunn is highly aware of the title‚Äôs history, which also raises the prospect of seeing some cameos from heroes who haven‚Äôt made it into his Phase One reboot, like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Woman and Aquaman</a>. As exciting as that is, the only way to find out the answers to all of these questions, sadly, is to wait.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6GdXaGutbHSrWSanJSewaq7zWarqGWknbJurtGarZ5lkaOxbsDHnmSbp5yZeqetzWaamquknruoec%2Bio55ll5a2r7%2BMmmSlp6RivKd50q6nqaeiqXw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-latest-addition-to-the-brave-and-the-bold-fan-casting-pile-gains-a-lot-of-support.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-latest-addition-to-the-brave-and-the-bold-fan-casting-pile-gains-a-lot-of-support.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-latest-addition-to-the-brave-and-the-bold-fan-casting-pile-gains-a-lot-of-support.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-latest-addition-to-the-brave-and-the-bold-fan-casting-pile-gains-a-lot-of-support.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-latest-addition-to-the-brave-and-the-bold-fan-casting-pile-gains-a-lot-of-support.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-latest-addition-to-the-brave-and-the-bold-fan-casting-pile-gains-a-lot-of-support.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./is-deadpool-on-netflix-where-to-stream-deadpool-and-deadpool-2.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./is-deadpool-on-netflix-where-to-stream-deadpool-and-deadpool-2.html>Is Deadpool on Netflix?
