It’s with a very sad, heavy heart that I tell you guys, Mitch and I are no longer together. I’m so devastated to be sharing this news with you and I am still processing the situation. Sadly, this was not our time and we agreed that the best decision for us right now is to part ways,” Tina shared with her 168,000 followers.</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>While Tina appears to be living her best life, modeling for brands like Hello Molly, attending sporting events like the FIFA Women’s World Cup, and more based on her Instagram profile, she might just find someone to share it with on the inaugural season of Love Island Games.</p><p data-characters=60 data-current-count=342 data-injectable=false>Who knows?

She decided to couple up with Henrik Stoltenberg (“stealing” him from Anna Iff), however, their relationship did not last long.</p><p data-characters=212 data-current-count=212 data-injectable=false>After breaking up with Henrik, Aurelia decided to self-eliminate from the beloved competition series on day 25, as she failed to make a connection with any of the other contestants besides Henrik — poor thing!</p><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>With the sneak peek of episode 15 teasing a relationship between her and Johnny Middlebrooks on Love Island Games, could Aurelia finally find her perfect match?
